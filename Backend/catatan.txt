1. Controller layer
This layer defines the API routes. The route handler functions let you deconstruct the request object, collect the necessary data pieces, and pass them on to the service layer for further processing.

2. Service layer
This layer is responsible for executing the business logic. It includes classes and methods that follow S.O.L.I.D programming principles, perform singular responsibilities, and are reusable. The layer also decouples the processing logic from the defining point of routes.

3. Data access layer
Responsible for handling database, this layer fetches from, writes to, and updates the database. It also defines SQL queries, database connections, models, ORMs, etc.
